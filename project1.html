        This coffee recipe app was designed with a clean and minimal user interface that emphasizes usability and a smooth user flow. The design offers an intuitive experience, allowing users to easily browse, save, and enjoy a variety of coffee recipes. Key features include a mood-based “Drink of the Day,” seamless navigation across Home, Favorites, and Profile sections, and a warm, coffee-inspired aesthetic that enhances the overall feel of the app. Tools used in this project include Figma and Canva.
