    <h1>Mugen Men</h1>
    <p>
        Mugen Men’s UI is inspired by Japanese design, showcasing a balanced and refined aesthetic. It features a neutral palette of black, white, and red, accented with subtle touches of complementary colors for visual interest. The interface combines modern functionality with traditional elements, including clear typography and understated cultural details, delivering an inviting and elegant user experience.
        This project was developed using tools such as Canva.
